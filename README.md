# devops-tools
DevOps tools with confugrations (Dockerized)
In this repository, you will find a set of open-source DevOps configurations and documentation on how I usually set them up on the environments I work on.
## Notice
In order to understand each, you will usually find a `README.md` file in each one of them.

>I will be working with **docker** a lot so make sure you have it installed on your host machine If you want to follow through some steps.

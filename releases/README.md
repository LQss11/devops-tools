# Release control
| Release type | Description / when to use                                                                                                                                                                                       | Example                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `major`      | Breaking changes are introduced. This may include new features and bugfixes.                                                                                                                                    | `0.9.8` -> `1.0.0`                  |
| `premajor`   | Like `major`, but to provide test versions before the final release. **WARNING:** Using this multiple times increases the major version each time.                                                              | `0.9.8` -> `1.0.0-0` -> `2.0.0-0`   |
| `minor`      | A new feature was added **without** breaking things. This may include bugfixes.                                                                                                                                 | `0.9.8` -> `0.10.0`                 |
| `preminor`   | Like `minor`, but to provide test versions before the final release. **WARNING:** Using this multiple times increases the minor version each time.                                                              | `0.9.8` -> `0.10.0-0` -> `0.11.0-0` |
| `patch`      | A bug was fixed without adding new functionality.                                                                                                                                                               | `0.9.8` -> `0.9.9`                  |
| `prepatch`   | Like `patch`, but to provide test versions before the final release. **WARNING:** Using this multiple times increases the patch version each time.                                                              | `0.9.8` -> `0.9.9-0` -> `0.9.10-0`  |
| `prerelease` | Increases only the prerelease suffix. If the current version is not a prerelease, this behaves like `prepatch`. You might want to use this to create multiple test versions (e.g. multiple `premajor` versions) | `0.9.8` -> `0.9.9-0` -> `0.9.9-1`   |

For the `pre*` release types, you can optioinally provide a custom postfix, e.g. `beta`. For example, `npm run release prepatch beta` would result in the following bump: `0.9.8 -> 0.9.9-beta.0`.

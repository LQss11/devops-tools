# Global settings and defaults.
global:
  # Scrape timeouts ensure that:
  #   (i)  scraping completes in reasonable time and
  #   (ii) slow queries are canceled early when the database is already under heavy load
  # Prometheus informs targets of its own scrape timeout (via the "X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds" request header)
  # so the actual timeout is computed as:
  #   min(scrape_timeout, X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds - scrape_timeout_offset)
  #
  # If scrape_timeout <= 0, no timeout is set unless Prometheus provides one. The default is 10s.
  scrape_timeout: 10s
  # Subtracted from Prometheus' scrape_timeout to give us some headroom and prevent Prometheus from timing out first.
  #
  # Must be strictly positive. The default is 500ms.
  scrape_timeout_offset: 500ms
  # Minimum interval between collector runs: by default (0s) collectors are executed on every scrape.
  min_interval: 0s
  # Maximum number of open connections to any one target. Metric queries will run concurrently on multiple connections,
  # as will concurrent scrapes.
  #
  # If max_connections <= 0, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 3.
  max_connections: 3
  # Maximum number of idle connections to any one target. Unless you use very long collection intervals, this should
  # always be the same as max_connections.
  #
  # If max_idle_connections <= 0, no idle connections are retained. The default is 3.
  max_idle_connections: 3

# The target to monitor and the collectors to execute on it.
target:
  # Data source name always has a URI schema that matches the driver name. In some cases (e.g. MySQL)
  # the schema gets dropped or replaced to match the driver expected DSN format.
  data_source_name: "sqlserver://sa:P@ssword@host.docker.internal:1433"

  # Collectors (referenced by name) to execute on the target.
  collectors: [mssql_*]

# Collector files specifies a list of globs. One collector definition per file.
collector_files:
  - "./mssql/dmv/*.collector.yml"
  - "./mssql/connection/*.collector.yml"
